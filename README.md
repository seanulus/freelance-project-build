# Freelance Project Week 2

## By Sean McDermott

# Description
Our goal for this week was to use responsive design to create the differing views from the wireframes we created last week.

# Specifications
* The views will resize based on responsive design and media queries.
* The menu will toggle when in the mobile view.


# Setup Requirements
* Clone this repository
* Run npm install to install all dependencies
* Run npm run start to build and start the development environment

# Notes
* To hold all images, **Make a folder called 'images' in the src/ directory**
* If you want to rename your assets folder, currently known as 'images', **Make sure to change the outputPath and inputPath in webpack.config.js > module > rules > file-loader to your desired assets directory name.**

# Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* Webpack
